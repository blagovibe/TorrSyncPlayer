# Changelog

All significant changes to the project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v1.1.5] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Makefile `release` target: single-command tag + push workflow
- Release workflow: release notes extracted from CHANGELOG.md (via awk)
- Release workflow: single-file portable Windows EXE with embedded Go backend
- Release workflow: SHA256 checksum verification for linuxdeploy downloads
- Release workflow: per-job permissions (contents:read/write)
- CI: race detector with CGO_ENABLED=1
- `backend/Dockerfile`: multi-stage Alpine build (1.6MB runtime)
- P2P: rooms and playback sync are brokered by the server over SSE (no STUN/TURN required)
- Auth: JWT token TTL configurable via JWT_TTL_HOURS environment variable
- Auth: structured audit logging for register/login events
- Auth: CORS origins reload every 5 minutes (no restart required)
- Security: IPv6 private range detection in proxy trust logic (fc00::/7, fe80::/10, ::1)
- Torrent service: 10 new tests (sanitizeFilename, nil buffer, Close idempotent, custom options, concurrent remove)
- Goroutine leak tests for P2P and Buffer services

### Fixed

- Auth: hardcoded dummy bcrypt hash fallback replaced with nil-safe handling
- Auth: `ErrInvalidCredentials` now returns AppError for correct HTTP 401 mapping
- API: `ErrTimeout` now returns HTTP 408 instead of 500
- P2P: Close timeout extracted to named constant
- Makefile: Go version check now uses proper semver comparison
- Sync: `latencyMs` validated for negative values (clamped to 0)
- CORS: exposed X-RateLimit-* headers for client access
- Server: default Go Server header removed from all responses
- Frontend: `MinRoomNameLength` synced to 1 (was 2, backend expects 1)
- Frontend: `testFormatDurationSecondsOnly` now tests seconds (was duplicate of zero test)
- Frontend: `build.sh` treats libmpv as optional, matching CMakeLists.txt
- Frontend: `handleApiError` body size limited to 64KB (OOM protection)
- API: documented health check response corrected (basic check returns only {"status":"ok"})
- Cleaned up stale artifacts (coverage, gosec-results.json)

### Security

- JWT authentication with token revocation
- bcrypt password hashing (cost=12)
- CSRF tokens with TTL 1h
- Rate limiting (10 req/min for auth, 60 req/min for API)
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, HSTS)
- CORS policies
- All input data validation
- TLS 1.2+ support

### Architecture

- Microservice architecture with independent services
- Thread safety via sync.RWMutex
- Graceful shutdown with timeouts
- Context-oriented operation management

### Known Issues

1. `frontend/src/main.cpp:336` — when launched with `--server-url`, the URL is parsed but not passed to NetworkManager
2. `frontend/src/networkmanager.cpp:301` — SSL errors are ignored in debug mode; production behavior is not implemented
3. In-memory UserStore/TokenRevocationStore — no persistence
4. No database integration
5. Buffer Service lacks unit tests
6. Frontend MainWindow/MpvWidget do not have unit tests
